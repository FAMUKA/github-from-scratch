# Github from Scratch

## Introduction

To understand what Github is and how it works, it is not necessary to know Git (though it helps to understand what it is – more on that later).

Here is a picture to illustrate the idea:

Imagine a certain brand of hammers (yes, the tool) becomes really pupular for all the right reasons. Let's call the brand "Hammerhub". Now you want to know what is so special about Hammerhub and the hammers they make. To experience that, it doesn't help to read about materials, manufacturing processes or blueprints of Hammerhub. You have to use that hammer for sculpting.

If you have never sculpted before, you can of course start with *any* hammer. But it certainly won't hurt to learn sculting with Hammerhub.

## The Idea

Github can be used to publish sites via [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com). Even better, these pages are processed by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), which allows to use [Yaml](http://yaml.org) data via [Liquid](http://wiki.shopify.com/Liquid)-templating, writing in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/markdown) and even [blogging](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/). Add [Github's online editing and creation features](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-editing-files-in-your-repository) and you have a complete and very powerful web publishing toolkit in the the browser.

While doing your first steps as outlined on the coming pages, you will build a personal history in your first repository (more on what a *repository* or "repo" very soon). And you do not even have to think about it. If you should decide to do more coding afterwards and want to learn how exactly Git works, you can check out your own repo and work with the already existing story of your very own commits.

## How to follow along

Just follow along the steps, click by click. If you don't understand anything.

**If possible, find a pear.**

Github's tagline is "social coding" – and you cannot do that alone. In the material, there will be sections entitled "If you have a peer". Those are the parts that will show you what is so special about Github (and other online code collaboration tools, of course).

## Set up

### Make a repository

You know what files and folders are? Then you know what a repository is. A repository is a special kind of folder, though. It keeps a journal about all changes that happened within it. That folder speaks in a language called "Git".

Maybe you know Windows recovery points. Or the OS X Time Machine Backups. What they do for your operating system or the files on your harddisk, Git does for a folder.

So let's set one up:

- Log into github (or create an account if you haven't done yet)

(SCR: new repo )
