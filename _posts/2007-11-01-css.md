At this point you have some files, containig beautifully structured HTML and pictures of cute cats. But that's not enough we say! Give it all some styling love.

#### Challenge
Use CSS to format texts and manipulate page layout.


#### How to do it

HTML is a language for structuring content. To control how our content looks, we use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). First, you have to create a new file in your repository. Create the folder `css` and in it the file `style.css`.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/css-1.png)

Edit this file and place the following code inside:

	h1 {
		color: hotpink;
	}

We will explain this in a minute, but first switch to your layout file, `default.html`. Here we will add a `<link>` element to our HTML *head*, that tells the browser where to get the style information.

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
		<head>
			<meta charset="UTF-8" />
			<title>{% raw %}{{ site.title }}{% endraw %}</title>
			<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css" />
		</head>
	    ...

This connects the *stylesheet* to your HTML pages. Now reload the browser tab with your site and marvel at your new shiny hotpink headline!

When you take a look at the CSS code above, you surely already figured out the basic concept of CSS. Let's have a closer look anyway:

##### Font formatting

`h1` is a *selector*. It *selects* the HTML element we wish to style. After that, in curly braces, we assigned the *value* `hotpink` to the *property* `color`. With this short CSS declaration you changed all `h1` elements in your site to be hotpink. So hot!

Now try it with another selector. Change all your paragraphs to be "skyblue"! Add another CSS declaration after the first one, then reload your page:

	p {
		color: skyblue;
	}

You can address every HTML element used in your pages in the same way. This type of selector is called ** element selector **, we will get to know other selectors a bit later.

In addition to text color you can assign other font formattings. Let's extend the style of your `h1`:

	h1 {
		color: hotpink;
		font-size: 44px;
		text-transform: uppercase;
	}

The different declarations you just added are quite self-explanatory. Keep an eye on the colons between the property name and value, and on the semi-colon at the end of each declaration.

#### If you have a peer
To recap some of the things you learned today, you could now take a look at your peer's repository and play with his CSS. Let's make his page more colorful!
