It's time to work with data. Your github page has motor beneath that can do stuff. Let's start that engine and give it some fuel.

## Challenge

Make a cinfiguration file and define a title for our site in there. Then use that data on the pages you created.

## How to do it

Make a file `_config.yaml` and add title as a key and your username as the value:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/create-repo-5.png)

Now edit `Ã¬ndex.html` and print that title in the headline

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/create-repo-5.png)

Do the same on `kittens.html`.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/create-repo-5.png)

Now go to the tab with your site and refresh. Oh my god!

### What did you do?

Below the Github is programm running called "Jekyll". It reads whatever you write in the config file into *variables* and can print them out anywhere on your page.

What is so great about that?

Imagine you want to change the title of your page. Imagine you do not have two pages (index and kittens), but, you also like ducks and bears and owls. Now you have five pages. If you had written the title of the page by hand, you would have to edit it five times. But since we're using the variable `{{ site.title }}`, it gets changed automatically on all pages.

Try to put some other variables in the config and print them out on your pages.
