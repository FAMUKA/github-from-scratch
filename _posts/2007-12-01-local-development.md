If you have written code before, you might have done it in a text editor on your own machine instead of online. To do so, we need to download our repository and synchronize local changes to GitHub.

### GUI Tools for Git and GitHub with a "normal" click-interface

GitHub is making its own GUI tools for Mac and Windows:

- [GitHub for Mac](http://mac.github.com/)
- [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com/)

There many many other clients available than those by GitHub. The Git documentation page holds [a short list](http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) and even more can be found through [the Delicious of Matthew McCullough](https://delicious.com/matthew.mccullough/gui,git).

If you are a **Linux** user, you might want to check out this answer on Stack Overflow: [Git GUI client for Linux](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1516720/git-gui-client-for-linux/1518844#1518844).

### Code editors

We recommend Sublime Text, which is widely used by many coders of all languages, has a rich ecosystem of plugins and themes and is available for Mac, Windows and Linux.

- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)

Sublime Text is free to try, but you need to buy a license after 30 days. If you want to go with something completely free/libre, try

- [gedit](https://projects.gnome.org/gedit/)



### The Command Line

If you want to use Git in the terminal, it helps to have done your first steps in [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_\(Unix_shell\)) before. We would recommend:

- start with [The CLI Crash Course on *Learn Code The Hard Way*](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/)
- then [Try Git](http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) 
- and continue with [the git section of this workshop]({{site.baseurl}}/git)
