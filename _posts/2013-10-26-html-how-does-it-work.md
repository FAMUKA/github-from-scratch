title:  "HTML - How does it work?"
---

The browser can do more than just print the text from the file. It speaks its own language, called "HTML" (HyperText Markup Language).

### Challenge

Make "hello world" a headline. Add a paragraph with the text "To the kittens!!1"

### How to do it

- edit `index.html`
- change `hello world` to `<h1>hello world</h1>`
- add a new line with the content: `<p>To the kittens!!1!</p>`

- go to the tab with yourusername.github.io and refresh the page

### What it should look like

### What did you do?

You used so called *tags* to *mark up* the text, so the browser knows what you want it to be.

You can imagine these tags being like uniforms: it is not so relevant who the person in the Police uniform is. It is more important that she is a Police Officer.

For the browser it doesn't really matter what your headline says. It is more important that it knows you want it to be a headline.

Tags usually consist of an opening tag (`<p>`) and a closing tag (`</p>`) and exist for all kinds of things. Some examples:

- Structured headlines (`<h1>, <h2>,.., <h6>``)
- bullet point lists (`<ul>`) with bullet point items (`<li>`)
- blocks of code examples (`<code>`)
- cited text (`<blockquote>`)
- images (`<img>`)
- links (`<a>`)

...and many, many more.
