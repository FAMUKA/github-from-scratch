TODO: chapter your own commit message


Above your list of files, there is a colored bar. And above that, there are some numbers.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/history-1.png)

You can click on those â€“ click on the one labeled "commits".

There is that "journal" we have talked about before. Here every change you made to any file is listed.

Every change was recorded as a "commit". Remember that word, it is important :)

"Commit" is both a noun and a verb. We already mentioned how *what was changed* in a file is written in a commit. You *made* those commits. You *committed* those changes to your *repository*.

Now these commits have odd names like `579c7a069d0`. *Do* ask why these names are so weird, but ask later. For now just remember that these are called *hashes*.

Click on one of those commit hashes:

You will be taken to a new site, where all the information about that change is: a *commit message* for example or the exact lines of code that where changed, how they looked before and how they look now.

Move the cursor over a line of code and a little bubble appears to the left:

Click on it and you can leave a comment:

If you have a peer, go to his repsitory and leave a comment in her code. Say something nice.
