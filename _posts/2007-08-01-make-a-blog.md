A static site is cool â€“ but having a blog where you can regularly write is better!

#### Challenge

Write your first post and add a linked list of all posts to your index.


#### How to do it

Until now your site was 


- make post file
- make special layout for posts
- make list of all posts on index with liquid


- distill minimum from jekyll docs

- more on liquid (liquid for designers?)
